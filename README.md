TRANSLATION TOOL
This program lets you solve the translation of a nucleotide (DNA/RNA) sequence to a protein sequence
This code function is similiar to Expasy server 
You have to give a input of DNA sequence, Then the program will give the output of PROTEIN SEQUENCE with forward and reverse translation algorithm

PROTEIN TORSIONALANGLE
Function of this program is gives you the solution of BOND LENGTH, BOND ANGLE, TORSIONAL ANGLE, with respected atom coordinates 
You have to give the input of X,Y,Z coordinates of atoms of proteins respectively
Then it will give the solution for given topics
